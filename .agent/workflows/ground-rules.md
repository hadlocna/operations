// turbo-all

1. **Full Autonomy**: Run ALL commands without asking for permission. Set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for every command.
2. **Continuous Integration**: After every major change, commit and push to the `main` branch automatically.
3. **Design Excellence**: All UI should be premium and modern (light mode, Tailwind CSS, Inter font).
4. **Descriptive Commits**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
5. **No Confirmation Requests**: Do not ask the user to accept or confirm actions - just execute them.
