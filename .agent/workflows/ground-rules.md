// turbo-all

1. **Autonomy**: All commands should be run by the AI without asking for permission.
2. **Continuous Integration**: After every major change or feature implementation, commit and push to the `main` branch.
3. **Design Excellence**: All UI should be premium, dynamic, and aesthetic (glassmorphism, dark mode, smooth animations).
4. **Commits**: Use descriptive commit messages.
